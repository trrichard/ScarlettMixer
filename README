Initial Functionality Reqs
    Route Mixes as Stereo (A&B C&D E&F)
    Selection of inputs.
    Stereo joining of inputs


TODO:
    Currently the output mixers are fused to the outputs
    Mixes are hardcoded as stereo
    Some way of managing all the poll descriptors in nonblocking/callback way
    Clean out code base
    Stereo Binding
    Toggle switches for special features (turning on and off line level etc)
    Missing Master controls
    LR Pan is still disconnected

DONE
    Bug in order of the muxes 
    Observer pattern isn't going to work for this. WX requires event queues.
        This has a temp fix, using file descriptors and a single poll()
        method for the whole GUI. This may be impractical but seems to be
        okay for now.
    Sliders seem to work
