Initial Functionality Reqs
    Route Mixes as Stereo (A&B C&D E&F)
    Selection of inputs.
    Stereo joining of inputs


TODO:
    Currently the output mixers are fused to the outputs
    Mixes are hardcoded as stereo
    Some way of managing all the poll descriptors in nonblocking/callback way
    Clean out code base
    Stereo Binding
    Toggle switches for special features (turning on and off line level etc)
    Missing Master controls
    Break out panning/reorganize to a different place
    Refactor ScarlettMixerAdaptor
    Fix the dev -d option
    Reload Pan/Gain matrix at startup
    Test on other scarletts
    Set pan to 50% with a button
    Race Condition in dev mixer


DONE
    Bug in order of the muxes 
    Observer pattern isn't going to work for this. WX requires event queues.
        This has a temp fix, using file descriptors and a single poll()
        method for the whole GUI. This may be impractical but seems to be
        okay for now.
    Sliders seem to work
    LR Pan works now



UML
How should I model the fading/panning strategy?
Mix Groups? 
A+B C+D E+F

Input === Input Channel === Fader === Mix Groups === Output Mix

                             ||
